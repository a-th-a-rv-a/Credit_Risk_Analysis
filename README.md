# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Credit risk modelling refers to estimating the risk associated with lending credit to a borrower. 
 If the lender fails to detect the credit risk in advance, it exposes them to the risk of default and loss of funds, thats why Lenders rely on the validation provided by credit risk analysis models to make key lending decisions on whether or not to extend credit to the borrower and the credit to be charged.

The probability of default, sometimes abbreviated as POD, is the likelihood that a borrower will default on their loan obligations.

#### **Project Overview**

In this project, different learning algorithms including KNN, Logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest have been used to find the best algorithm for credit risk . SMOTE has been used for handling the imbalanced data. KNN Imputer is used for imputing the missing values.

#### **Dataset and features**

The dataset for this credit risk modelling project has been taken from kaggle.The dataset classifies the credit risk of borrower with respect to various features such as Age , Income , Employment length , Home ownership and other attributes of loan such as Interest Rate , Purpose etc.
